(e.g., "Best Value Grocers", "TnH Fresh Mart") price_per_unit (NUMERIC): The unit price at which the competitor sells the product, providing a basis for direct price comparisons. This field is essential for analyzing price competitiveness and identifying under- or overpricing. start_date (DATE): The date when the competitor's price becomes valid, marking the beginning of the price observation period. This allows for tracking price changes over time. end_date (DATE): The date when the competitor's price validity ends, marking the close of the price observation period.
